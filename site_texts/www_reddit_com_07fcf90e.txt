One of the criticisms brought against Nietzsche by Russell is this, What are we to think of Nietzsche's doctrines? How far are they true? Are they in any degree useful? Is there in them anything objective, or are they the mere power-phantasies of an invalid? It is undeniable that Nietzsche has had a great influence, not among technical philosophers, but among people of literary and artistic culture. It must also be conceded that his prophecies as to the future have, so far, proved more nearly right than those of liberals or Socialists. If he is a mere symptom of disease, the disease must be very wide-spread in the modern world. Nevertheless there is a great deal in him that must be dismissed as merely megalomaniac. - A History of Western Philosophy What Russell is saying is quite true. I mean Nietzsche's influence has not been among the technical philosophers but artists, literary authors and at most psychology. Nietzsche does not follow any systemic philosophy and instead draws heavily from literature and aesthetics. A great deal of it however comes from post-Kantian nature of philosophy, where most prominent philosophers simply tried to overcome philosophy starting from Schopenhauer to Kierkegaard to Nietzsche, through different means. Even at the peak of analytic philosophy, Ludwig Wittgenstein (belonging in the same tradition), did not show much interest in objective philosophy of the tradition and kept following literature as part of his influence. Same could be said of Heidegger who literally shifts traditional philosophy to subjectivity of Being (whatever you call it). So, is philosophy basically useless? Which Nietzsche was trying to overcome through aesthetics and art (at least in his early works)?
