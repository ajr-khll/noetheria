I'm reading Nietzsche and I'm unable to understand what does he exactly want humans to do. All the time he comes around the idea that we should reject slave morality, not be spiders, leave mankind in the past, understand the implications of God's dead and above all, embrace life. But what does he exactly mean by that? That we should have fun? Drink a lot? Travel? Have sex? Cultivate the arts and science? I'm reluctant to think he was meaning some 'live life to the fullest' or 'become the best version of yourself' self-help shit, but I can't understand what was exactly the alternative to being a moral slave in Nietzsche's thought. Was he defending some kind of Greece/Renaissance ideal? Was he a transhumanist? I've heard that he regarded César Borgia as the ultimate example of the Übermensch but how so? The guy lost his empire. I don't understand. Is there some book that I can read to "decipher" Nietzsche's words? Thank you in advance!
