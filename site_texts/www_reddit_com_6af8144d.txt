I'm not in favor of fascism in any reasonable way, so this isn't me trying to justify my pre-held beliefs or anything. I'm just a bit curious about the subject. I want to know if there are any arguments in favor of fascism that actually have some merit to them and can't easily be dismissed. I know big parts of fascist belief is the need for a "strong man" leader and that the populace cannot lead the state, the importance for a mono-ethnic state in achieving stability and unity, and the emphasis as the state as the unit in which one should identify with, i.e., for the glory of the state kind of stuff. This type of rational leads to ethnic cleansing and forcing your will onto other states/nations, and such. I know these are very suspect in their truthfulness, and they have been, justifiably so, rejected as reasonable forms of political philosophy. But is there any sort of argument in favor of this type of regime that has some merit? I'm sure there are some good arguments in favor of this stuff or has every single one not stood up the test of time? Again, I do not condone fascism, and even if there were some sound arguments in favor, I do not think it would warrant its acceptance as an idealogy to pursue.
